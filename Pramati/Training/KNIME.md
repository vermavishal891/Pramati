1\) What is the tool about?

Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME), is a free and open-source data
analytics, reporting and integration platform. KNIME integrates various
components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data
pipelining concept.

A graphical user interface and use of JDBC allows assembly of nodes
blending different data sources, including preprocessing (ETL:
Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling, data analysis and
visualization without, or with only minimal, programming.

2\) Pros comparing its competitor

-   Users can visually create data flows (or pipelines)
-   Selectively execute some or all analysis steps, and later inspect
    the results, models, and interactive views
-   Plugins can be added to increase functionality
-   Support differents types of database(through JDBC or native
    connectors: SQLite, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Vertica and H2)
-   Additional plugins allows the integration of methods for Text
    mining, Image mining, as well as time series analysis.
-   KNIMEs core-architecture allows processing of large data volumes
    that are only limited by the available hard disk space (not limited
    to the available RAM). E.g. KNIME allows analysis of 300 million
    customer addresses, 20 million cell images and 10 million
    molecular structures.

3\) Cons comparing its competitor

-   Lacks multiuser interface
-   It takes time to learn the whole features
